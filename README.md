# Ultrasonic Cleaner Servo Button Actuator (UCB) by Nicholas Bratvold

## Overview
The Ultrasonic Cleaner Servo Button Actuator (UCB) is a project developed by Nicholas Bratvold to enhance the functionality of ultrasonic cleaners by automating button presses using a servo motor. This open-source project aims to provide an affordable and customizable solution for users looking to automate their ultrasonic cleaning processes.

## Features
- Button Automation: The UCB uses a servo motor to press the buttons on ultrasonic cleaner devices, allowing for hands-free operation.
- Customizable Settings: Users can easily customize the code to adapt it to different ultrasonic cleaner models and button configurations.
- Compact Design: The hardware design is compact and can be easily integrated into existing ultrasonic cleaner setups.

## Hardware Requirements
To implement the UCB, you will need the following hardware:

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno)
- Servo motor
- Ultrasonic cleaner device

## Getting Started
Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/nicholasbratvold/UCB.git

Install Dependencies:
Ensure that you have the necessary Arduino libraries installed. Refer to the documentation [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide) for details. 

Connect Hardware:
Connect the servo motor to the designated pins on the Arduino board and ensure proper wiring with the ultrasonic cleaner.  

Upload Code:
Open the Arduino IDE, load the UCB code, and upload it to your Arduino board.

Run the UCB:
Power on your ultrasonic cleaner and Arduino board. The UCB will automate the button presses according to the programmed sequence.

## CAD Files
We've 3D-printed a compact enclosure to house the UCB system, ensuring a tidy and secure setup for seamless integration into your ultrasonic cleaning workflow.
